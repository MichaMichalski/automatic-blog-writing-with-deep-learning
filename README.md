This project was highly inspired by Youtube videos with titles as "How to make money online".
Within these videos serveral aspects on how to earn some money on the side are shown. Almost every single one of these shows "blogging" as a viable way to earn money.

This means putting up a simple website in which you can write blog articles about whatever topic you are interested in, your "niche".

In this project I am going to find out wether it's possible to train a Deep Learning model in order to write blog articles related to traveling.
